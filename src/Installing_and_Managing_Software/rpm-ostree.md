# `rpm-ostree` Overview

> **Attention**: Using `rpm-ostree` Layering packages irresponsibly can be **destructive** and may prevent updates as well as other issues until the layered packages are uninstalled.

Install Fedora Linux packages by installing them with `rpm-ostree`.

- This is known as "layering packages" to the image.
- Layering packages will **require** a system reboot when it finishes creating the new deployment with the package(s) added to your image.
- Use this method as a **last resort** and for anything at a "system-level" only.

## Common `rpm-ostree` Terminal Commands:

```
rpm-ostree install <package>
```

Installs Fedora package(s) to the system that stay between updates.

```
rpm-ostree uninstall <package>
```

Uninstalls any layered packages added to the system.

```
rpm-ostree search <package>
```

Searches for Fedora packages that can be installed.

## Installing RPM files

Fedora [Distrobox containers](https://docs.bazzite.gg/Installing_and_Managing_Software/Distrobox/) should be used for most `.rpm` files, but sometimes they need to be installed to your host.

You can install RPM binaries **to your host** with `rpm-ostree` by entering:

```
rpm-ostree install <package>.rpm
```

You may need to copy the full path (`/path/to/rpmfile.rpm`) for it to install properly.

> **Note**: The downside of installing local RPM files outside of the Fedora repositories is updates for the specific RPM package will not apply automatically.

## How do I add [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org) repositories?

> **Note**: It is highly advised to **not** use third-party COPR repos if possible, so be aware there are risks associated with it including broken updates until removed.

1. Download the .repo file and save it to `/etc/yum.repos.d/`

2. Then install the package(s) with `rpm-ostree`

3. Reboot

If you experience issues updating your system due to GPG signature issues, then this can be fixed by either removing the COPR repository, or editing the file by changing `gpgcheck=1` to `gpgcheck=0` (or similar) and saving it **at your own risk**.

There is also an experimental `copr` utility script that ships with Bazzite. Run `copr --help` in the terminal for to see usage documentation, and the source code for the helper script can be found [here](https://github.com/ublue-os/COPR-command).

## **MAJOR** caveats using `rpm-ostree`

Layering packages can cause **severe consequences** including:

- Break upgrades or prevent rebasing.
- Conflict with existing packages as part of the image leading to dependency issues.
- Updates will take longer to download as you layer more packages to your system.

Layering packages are mostly intended for system-level applications, libraries, and other dependencies. It is recommended to use Flatpak, Homebrew, Distrobox containers, AppImage, etc. **before** installing software with `rpm-ostree`. Typical users should **not** be using `rpm-ostree` to install end-user graphical applications at all to avoid problems in the future.  It is **highly recommended** to only layer packages when absolutely necessary especially if the application can be obtained through other methods.

## How to remove **ALL** layered packages

If you run into issues upgrading due to a layered package conflict, then either optionally uninstall the conflicted package(s) or remove all layered packages with this **command**:

```bash
rpm-ostree reset
```

## Image Information

See information about image build date, update channel, layered packages, etc. by **entering this command in a host terminal**:

```command
rpm-ostree status
```

## Additional Commmands

>**Warning**: Certain `rpm-ostree` and `ostree` commands can permanently remove deployments and cause other destructive behavior, so enter them at your own risk.

View the full range of `rpm-ostree` and `ostree` commands with the following two commands:

```
rpm-ostree help
```

```
ostree help
```
