![TDP|690x431, 75%](../../img/TDP.jpeg)

There are a few options for TDP Controls that work with Bazzite:

- The [HHD-overlay](https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd/blob/master/readme.md) supports TDP controls.
  - Also has a desktop app that is pre-installed, look for the Handheld Daemon app in Desktop Mode.
- [SimpleDeckyTDP](https://github.com/aarron-lee/SimpleDeckyTDP) supports TDP, GPU, Power Governor, and among other settings.
  - Also has a [graphical application](https://github.com/aarron-lee/SimpleDeckyTDP-Desktop), but needs to be manually installed.
- [PowerControl](https://github.com/mengmeet/PowerControl) supports TDP, GPU, and fan controls on select devices.

### How do I open the HHD Overlay?

OneXPlayer devices are recommended to use the Steam Controller emulation.

#### Desktop Controls

Desktop Mode Controller Layout: It may not exist by default if Steam doesn't setup your handheld controller properly. This can be fixed in Steam's controller settings.
