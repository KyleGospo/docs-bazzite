## Alternative Installation Method

If none of the above errors are relevant to your issue, or you still have problems installing Bazzite, then try following our alternative installation method:

[**Try installing Bazzite by rebasing from Fedora Kinoite (KDE Plasma) or Fedora Silverblue (GNOME)**](/General/Installation_Guide/alternate-install-guide.md).

!!! note

    The alternative installation method is also useful for **downloading a smaller ISO** and **may resolve issues with downloading Bazzite's ISO**.
